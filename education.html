<p>I was chosen as a high school sophomore to attend the Mount's summer program: Project Scope. Project Scope was named a presidential 'Points of Light' project. Taking college classes in high school gave me perspective on how college life might be. The academic demand was intense, and I learned that studying must be priority if success is your goal! After high school, I attended and completed my studies there. Overall, college was a challenging and expansive experience. This experience prepared me for a lifetime of learning.</p>
